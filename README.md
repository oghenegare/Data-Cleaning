# Data-Cleaning
I have documented a comprehensive account of my step-by-step process for cleaning a dataset provided by sofifa.com.
The original file contained player names with special characters that required cleaning, as well as columns with irregularities in units and value formats.
To address these issues, I utilized Excel and it's functions to perform thorough checks for missing data, duplicate data, inconsistent data, correct data types, and data accuracy, making necessary corrections along the way.
I included written formulas, screenshots, and even links to videos to help explain how I made the corrections.
I hope this gives you a good idea of my thought process and helps you understand the steps I took!
