Data cleaning refers to the process of identifying and correcting or removing errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies from a dataset.
It is an essential step in data analysis because it ensures that the data is accurate, complete, and consistent,
which in turn leads to more reliable and accurate insights.

Data cleaning involves several tasks such as removing duplicate data, correcting misspellings, filling in missing values, standardizing data formats,
and identifying and removing outliers. The ultimate goal is to transform the raw data into a clean and organized dataset that can be used for analysis.

Overall, data cleaning is a crucial step in any data analysis project, as it ensures that the insights drawn from the data are valid and reliable,
and can be used to make informed decisions.
