To begin cleaning, I opened the .csv file on my notepad and saved it as a .txt file. i then imported the file into excel.
after which i converted my range into a table. It is worthy to note that the file had 18979 columns and 77 rows.

The ID's were unique sets of numbers, and no duplicate was found, meaning it was good to go. 

Moved to the PlayerNames, comprising of NAMES and LongNames. The PlayerNames had special characters that had to be cleaned.
However, "CLEAN FUNCTION" could not be used because excel couldn't understabd the characters. 
The PlayerUrl contained the LongNames, so i extracted it using MID, FIND, LEN, PROPER and SUBSTITUTE FUNCTIONS" in the formula below

=SUBSTITUTE(PROPER(MID([@playerUrl],FIND("/",[@playerUrl],29)+1,LEN([@playerUrl])-FIND("/",[@playerUrl],29)-8)),"-"," ")

The MID FUNCTION extracted the LongNames of the players from the playerUrl using "/" as a delimiter. Because the playerUrl had more than one "/",
i used the FIND FUNCTION to select the specific "/" i would use as my delimiter.
The PROPER FUNCTION was used to format the text into proper text format, i.e. Capitalizing each word.
The SUBSTITUTE FUNCTION replaced the "-" in the text with a space(" ")

The PhotoURL and PlayerURL columns contained links to the player image and details respectively.
These columns were both hidden from the overall dataset.

The Nationality, Age and Club columns had some repeating values, but this is absolutely normal, since clubs,
countries have more than a single player, and there is no 'monopoly" of Age

The CONTRACT column (oh my word!) had inconsistencies in the data.
it contained the "start year" and "end year" of some players contract, dates of players "on loan" and also players who are "free agents".

To clean this, i created two new columns to hold the "CONTRACT START YEAR" and "CONTRACT END YEAR" i used the formulas

=IF(LEN([@[Contract Start Yr]])= 11, LEFT([@[Contract Start Yr]],4),"null")
and
=IF(LEN([@[Contract Start Yr]])= 11, RIGHT([@[Contract Start Yr]],4),"null")

Since all valid CONTRACT YEAR had 11 characters, i used the IF and LEN FUNCTION to check for the length of the string,
and then return the CONTRACT START YEAR(LEFT FUNTION) or The CONTRACT END YEAR (RIGHT FUNCTION) respectively, whle returning "null" for the players on loan and free transfer.

The column that showed the different positions of each player was removed because it was repetitive and 
included additional positions if the player played in more than one position.
There was already another column that showed the player's best position.

The 'HEIGHT' and 'WEIGHT' COLUMNS were stored in text format and had inconsostencies in their units, for the WEIGHT "75kg and 171lbs" while the HEIGHT was in "172cm and 5'11""
To clean these, i created two extra columns. 

For the HEIGHT COLUMNS;
I used FIND and REPLACE to delete the """, and used "'" as a delimiter to seperate the "ft and in".
i converted them to cm using
=INT(CONVERT([@Column7],"ft","cm") + CONVERT([@Column8], "in","cm"))

For the WEIGHT COLUMNS;
I used 
=INT(CONVERT(LEFT([@Weight],FIND("l",[@Weight])-1),"lbm","kg")) 
to convert the lbs to kg, this however brought an error for cells already in kg. So i used 
=IF(ISERROR([@Column7]),LEFT([@Weight],FIND("k",[@Weight])-1),[@Column7])
to merge both weights, keeping them in number format. Renamed the WEIGHT column to include the units.

For the VALUE, WAGE and RELEASE CLAUSE COLUMNS, i used similar formula to clean and convert to number format.

=IF(RIGHT([@Value],1) = "m",LEFT([@Value],LEN([@Value]) -1) * 1000000,IF(RIGHT([@Value],1) = "k",LEFT([@Value],LEN([@Value])-1)*1000,IFERROR([@Value],0)))

The IR, W/F and SM COLUMNS had a special character "★", with unicode '9733'. The formula below was used to clean the character.

=LEFT([@IR],1)

The Attacking, Crossing, Finishing, Heading_accuracy, short_passing, Volleys, Skill, Dribbling, Curve, Fk-accuracy, Long-passing,
Ball-control, Movement, Acceleration, ‘Spring-speed, Agility, Reactions, Balance, Power, Shot-Power, Jumping, Stamina, Strength, Long-shot, Mentality,
Aggression, Interception, Positioning, Vision, Penalties, Composure, Defending, Marking, Standing-tackle, Sliding_tackle,
Goalkeeping, Gk-handling, Gk-diving, Gk-kicking, Gk-positioning, Gk-reflexes, Total-stats, Base-stats, Pace, Shooting, Passing, DRI, DEF,
physicality, Best-position, Preferred-foot columns

were all converted to number format, and hidden from the main table.
